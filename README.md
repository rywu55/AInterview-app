Our team has created a mock interview tool that takes a user's resume to generate personalized behavorial interview questions. The user can then be prompted to start the interview and respond with answers to specific questions. These responses are then fed into our backend speech analysis program that analyzes a response based on different NLP, sentiment, and more techniques.
