I’m a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science with a minor in business. I’ve been interested in coding ever since I did FIRST robotics as an elementary schooler, we would build with lego bricks with our hands but we also did some drag and drop programming, and I was intrigued by the creativity that came with being able to code — almost like playing with virtual lego bricks to build a piece of software.
